      <h2> About Coink</h2>
      <p> Coink was designed for my final project. The objective of this project was to create a responsive money-saving-tool to help people save quickly in preparation for a big purchase or expenditure</p>
      <p> The App: Coink was created to be a trusted financial motivator. Coink’s goal is to help users plan and execute large purchases “goals”. Like goals, everyone’s financial situation is unique. Coink helps measure and monitor the user’s
        specific finances - income and expenditures - and provides insights to help make goals become reality.</p>
      <p> My Role: Competitor Research, User Testing, User Flow, Wireframing, Prototyping, UI-Design </p>
      <p> Tools: Sketch, Invision, Balsamiq </p>

      <h2> User Stories </h2>
      <p> From the user stories, a user flow was created to determine the path the user would be taking and which screens would be important to include in the app. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>As a user, I want to see a dashboard of my finances clearly and visually, so that I can see how much I am spending on what at a glance. </li>
        <li>As a user, I need to be able to tell the tool what my savings goal is and how long I have to reach it, so that I can save accordingly. </li>
        <li>As a user, I want the money-saving tool I use to be motivational, so that I stay on track with my goals. </li>
      </ol>

      <h2> User Flow </h2>
      <p>From the user stories, a user flow was created to determine the path the user would be taking and which screens would be important to include in the app. </p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>The user flow was then used to create the first initial wireframe sketches in Balsamiq. The blueprints of the screens were then converted to mid-fidelity wireframes.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div>
      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>In order to find out if the screens created were easy to understand and functional, the wireframes were uploaded to Invision for prototyping. Three users were given the task to Sign Up with Coink and navigate to their homepage.

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>The users found the app easily navigable and straightforward. A notable observation based on feedback was to create additional on-boarding screens rather than have all the personal goal questions on one single screen.

      <h2>Wireframe Progression</h2>
      <p>After reviewing the feedback from the user testing the mid-fidelity screens were then adapted, additional on-boarding screens were added understanding more about the users goal. Then the style, typography, colors were added to the wireframes. A
        responsive screen was created to showcase what the app is capable of.</p>
